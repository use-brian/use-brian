/**
 * Landing route. Resolves the user's destination based on workspace
 * membership:
 *
 *   - 1 workspace        → /w/:workspaceId    (skip the picker → doc)
 *   - 0 or n workspaces  → /teams             (picker)
 *
 * The membership fetch carries the user's access_token so the backend
 * applies RLS. A fetch error leaves the list empty and falls through to
 * /teams, which re-fetches and renders real workspaces (or bounces to
 * /login). A genuinely empty list is effectively unreachable — every
 * user has a Personal workspace auto-created at signup.
 *
 * Signed out, the destination depends on the edition — see
 * `lib/oss-entry.ts`. The hosted edition goes to /login for Google OAuth;
 * the open edition has no login, so its root IS the local-owner session.
 * This path is not proxy-guarded (`/` is absent from GUARDED_PREFIXES), so
 * this redirect is the only thing standing between a self-hosted visitor
 * and a Google button that can never complete.
