/**
 * Workflow lifecycle policy — the pure decision core of the staleness /
 * digestion / archival sweep (mig 308).
 *
 * Workflows age the way skills do (docs/architecture/engine/skill-system.md →
 * "Lifecycle states"): `active` → `stale` after an idle window → `archived`
 * after a longer one — and the one-off class (manual / schedule-once trigger
 * that ran at most once) is eventually hard-deleted after an archived grace
 * period. `pinned` is the user veto that exempts a workflow from every
 * automatic transition. Enabled event / webhook workflows and workflows with
 * a live scheduled fire are ARMED LISTENERS — idle-by-design, never staled
 * or archived while armed.
 *
 * This module is deliberately side-effect free: the sweep worker
 * (packages/api/src/workers/workflow-lifecycle-worker.ts) loads rows, calls
 * `decideLifecycle` per row, and applies the returned action. Every rule
 * lives here so the policy is table-testable without a database.
 *
 * Spec: docs/architecture/features/workflow-lifecycle.md.
 * Component tag: [COMP:workflow/lifecycle]
